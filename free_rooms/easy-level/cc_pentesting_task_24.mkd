We are given only the IP address of the box, therefore the logical thing to do would be to start with a nmap scan. Input the following command into the terminal:

> nmap -A \<GIVEN-IP-ADDRESS\> 

The "-A" enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute. This means we will  gather more information from our scan but it might take longer.

After the scan has finished, should see something like this: 

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 12:96:a6:1e:81:73:ae:17:4c:e1:7c:63:78:3c:71:1c (RSA)
|   256 6d:9c:f2:07:11:d2:aa:19:99:90:bb:ec:6b:a1:53:77 (ECDSA)
|_  256 0e:a5:fa:ce:f2:ad:e6:fa:99:f3:92:5f:87:bb:ba:f4 (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works

```

We can see that SSH on port 22 is open and HTTP on port 80 is open. 

Since we do not have any credentials for the SSH, it would make sense to see what is on HTTP.

If we navigate to \<GIVEN-IP-ADDRESS\> in a browser, then we see that it is the ubuntu default page. 

There must be more to this web server than meets the eye therefore we will do some subdomain brute forcing 

For this, I used gobuster and entered the following command: 

> gobuster dir -u \<GIVEN-IP-ADDRESS\> -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt 

dir = Uses directory/file brutceforcing mode

-u = the target URL 

-w = path to the wordlist 

-x = File extension(s) to search for (separated ONLY by commas)

After the brute forcing has finished, we should see something like this: 

```
===============================================================
2020/01/01 00:00:00 Starting gobuster
===============================================================
/secret (Status: 301)
===============================================================
2020/01/01 00:00:00 Finished
===============================================================

```
This shows us that there is a directory named "/secret" on that web server. 

If we navigate to the URL \<GIVEN-IP-ADDRESS\>/secret, strangely we see that is it an empty page 

This is strange however, it might be that there is another subdomain beneth the "/secret" subdomain

Therefore if we run another gobuster but specifically for the URL = \<GIVEN-IP-ADDRESS\>/secret, we can see if we can find anything else: 

> gobuster dir -u \<GIVEN-IP-ADDRESS\>\secret -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt

However from the console output we see that there is no findings. 

This suggests that there are no more hidden directories therefore there might be some hidden files here instead 

By running this command, we can look for hidden files in the "/secret" directory

> gobuster dir -u \<GIVEN-IP-ADDRESS\> -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt -x .html,.php,.txt

Similar to the previous commands but with the addition of the "-x" flag

-x = File extension(s) to search for (separated ONLY by commas)

From the console output, we should see something like: 

```

```
